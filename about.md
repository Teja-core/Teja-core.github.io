Hi, I'm **Teja Vayila**, an Embedded Firmware Engineer with strong interest in building efficient, reliable, and scalable firmware for real-world devices.

I enjoy working close to hardware — configuring registers, debugging peripherals, and solving timing-related challenges.

### My Embedded Journey
- Started with C and microcontrollers during B.Tech  
- Trained professionally in Embedded C and STM32  
- Worked on automotive testing and firmware development  

### My Focus Areas
- Bare-metal firmware development  
- STM32 & ARM Cortex platforms  
- Embedded communication protocols  
- Real-time debugging and performance tuning  

I use this platform to share my learning experiences, project insights, and technical breakdowns for aspiring embedded engineers.
