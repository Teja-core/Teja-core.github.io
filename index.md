# Teja Vayila  
### Embedded Firmware Engineer 

I design and develop **reliable, low-level firmware** for STM32-based and ARM Cortex systems, focusing on performance, stability, and real-time behavior.

💡 I’m passionate about building smart embedded products and solving complex hardware-software integration challenges.

## 🔧 What I Do

- Develop bare-metal and RTOS-based firmware  
- Design low-level drivers (UART, I2C, SPI, CAN)  
- Debug hardware-software integration issues  
- Optimize firmware for real-time performance  
- Build scalable embedded architectures

## ❤️ Why Embedded Systems?

I chose embedded systems because I love working close to the hardware layer — optimizing memory, manipulating registers, and seeing code directly control real-world devices.

My mission is to become a highly skilled firmware engineer contributing to innovative embedded and IoT products.
